9,Mangling Ruby with TracePoint,"Mangling Ruby with TracePoint

Introduced in Ruby 2.0, TracePoint is meant to help developers better instrument their code for debugging and performance reasons, but there's more to TracePoint than that!

In this talk we'll learn about TracePoint while building several example projects. Once we know the basics we'll use TracePoint to do things to Ruby that we couldn't have done otherwise.

By the end of this talk  you'll be able to frighten and amaze your friends when you show them things like true abstract classes and interfaces in Ruby, just like Java! Yikes!

10,GET /better,"Becoming a well sought after and ""better"" developer is easier than you think. There are no tonics or elixirs you can take that will instantly make a desirable engineer, but there are easily defined steps to that goal.

In this talk we will discuss the different avenues that are at your disposal to become a better developer. These achievable steps have led me to a successful software development career, and they can help you too.

This is not a get rich quick scheme, there is sweat and hard work involved, but it'll fun. So let's get better!"
11,A Big Look at MiniTest,"In Ruby 1.9 the MiniTest testing framework was introduced. This lightweight testing framework is fast, powerful, and easy to understand, yet so many people over look it.

In this talk we'll look at using MiniTest in a simple, non-Rails, project and then work up to using it in a Rails application. We'll look at both the TestUnit and RSpec style syntaxes that MiniTest offers. We'll also learn to write custom matchers, run specific files, and much more.

Testing is important to all Ruby developers, and with such a powerful testing library already bundled with Ruby, shouldn't we learn how to use it?

The practice of TDD, however, isn't as straightforward as we would like. We frequently get stuck, not knowing what to test next, and how or when to generalize the code.

In this talk, I will introduce the Transformation Priority Premise, and show how we can apply a little mathematical rigour to infer our testing paths, thus reducing or completely eliminating impasses."

40,Finding things with Amazon Cloud Search and (Active)-Asari,"Amazon Cloud Search provides a powerful mechanism for adding search to your application…. It automatically sales things for you and indexes your data as you add thing. Integrating it with your Ruby application can be a challenge, especially in multiple environments. It has crazy domain names, and requires a lot of glue code to automate spinning up environments, and search operations. Thankfully we have Asari and Active-Asari to make that easier. Join us as we talk about search, tools you can use and how Asari and Active-Asari can make it more approachable when you need to move beyond database and solr based search in your application."
41,Building C extensions in Ruby,"From time to time, when building Ruby apps, you realise there are no libraries available for what you need. Even worse, Ruby doesn't quite perform as quickly as we would expect in certain areas. There are, however, a lot of high performance, mature technologies built in C that can easily be ported to be used with Ruby. By doing this, we get to keep using our favourite language, opening it to a plethora of applications that were not possible before, and still keep things snappy.

In this talk, I will walk you through the ins and outs of building Spyglass, an OpenCV binding for Ruby. I will also talk in detail about some gotchas (memory management, lack of threading), good practices (C objects as first class citizens, how to properly test extensions), why `mkmf` needs to be retired and some great examples of extensions you probably already use and should be looking at."
42,analytics for the busy ruby developer,"Our applications have the potential to produce a lot of data. Every time a user clicks a button, buys something, or our application does any number of things we have the opportunity to gain useful insights. But where do you begin? Should I gather every data point I can think of? What tools work the best? There is a lot of talk and hype about analytics. In this session, let's take a look at what goes into mining data and analyzing the insights. We'll discuss different approaches to gathering, storing, and querying data, how to determine the KPIs to focus on, and how to interpret and use information in meaningful ways. While you may not be a statistician, see how some basic statistics can help you to start to wrangle your data."
43,[Workshop] Testing - Zero To Hero,"So testing... How does it work?

be solved.

Try doing things with TDD, try doing things building tests after. Let's use
RSpec, TestUnit and MiniSpec to test different techniques and perfect our
tests.

Look at how we can apply these to our real world problems to make our lives
easier and our software better!"

We'll also talk about patterns that we've found useful and things that didn't work out that well. We'll show the tooling that makes all this possible and how it integrates with Hubot to allow the Enterprise team to collaborate.

#### Background

This talk is based on my experience of the past 18 months working with [Bulletproof](http://www.bulletproof.net) in Sydney. I inherited an Rails application that had grown from a single purpose app to the company's CRM application, under the pressure of a rapidly growing business.

As if this wasn't challenging enough, the CRM application had been built on top of another legacy Perl system that dates back more than a decade ago. Although these mostly internal applications don't experience much load, they are still very critical to Bulletproof's business. "

As a community, I believe that we can be better than this. We can all learn together on how to do security reporting and disclosing in a right way. Be responsible, polite, and respectful to everyone so that we're not ruining anyone's day when a vulnerability has been exposed."
61,Beyond Platform As A Service (PaaS),"When it comes to deploying web applications most Rubysts turn to Plaform as a Service (PaaS) solutions like Heroku and Engine Yard which is cool, but it has it's limitations. Let's level up!

In this session I am going to show you how to roll your own IaaS cloud environment for maximum flexibility and control. I will use the popular fog gem to demonstrate how to do the following:

Create a server
Configure this server with chef
Configure a load balancer
Configure a custom network
Along the way, I will demonstrate how fog works and provide you with a sample template that can be applied to all of your projects."
62,Dear Everyone: Let's Contribute to Open Source!,"It has been a while since I started contributing to open source, and I have to say that the starting process is not really that smooth. Every time I'm giving a talk at several places, people was keep asking me on how I started contributing to an open source. I believe There are a lot of things you need to do to get started, and you might probably get tired of it and give up if you didn't get it right the first time. I'd like this talk to encourage and inspire more people to contribute to an open source project, by giving them the idea on how to get started and how it should be done.

Also, as a maintainer of two gems, I think I would like to spread the word as well on how to lower the barrier to contribution. That way, new people could easily get started when they wanted to contribute back to the community, like I did."
63,Building for iOS and OS X with Ruby (RubyMotion is Awesome!),"The world of developing iOS and OS X applications can be a scary one. Objective-C is a bizzare looking language for most Ruby developers, Xcode is a complex tool and learning to use all the parts you need can be really hard, and then there is the frameworks... THERE IS SO MANY OF THEM!

We can get past this though, and bring our amazing Ruby skills to make things for those shiny Apple products we love so much. RubyMotion has opened up a whole new world of opportunities, and it's terminal workflow means you get to avoid Xcode for almost everything. All that's left is for me to show you how to get setup, show you the tools, give you an introduction to the frameworks and wrappers we can use, and show you places to learn more."
64,Go for the Rubyist,"Why are so many Rubyists buzzing about Go? This hot new language that grew out of Google just a few years ago is taking the world by storm and is generating a lot of buzz in the Ruby community.

In this talk we'll look at the highlights of Go and try and figure out what the hype is all about, and we'll do with a keen Rubyist eye. We'll also look at where it would make sense in our Ruby/Rails projects to extend them with this highly concurrent, and performant language.

What do you say my fellow Rubyists; are you up for the challenge of learning something a bit different?"
65,Security Engineering in Ruby,"Believe it or not, proper application security isn't just for banks or the NSA. Recent high-profile attacks have cost web companies millions of dollars and thousands of users. These attacks beg the question, how should you protect your business and customers? You are probably salting your hashes and encrypting your traffic already, but there are much more fundamental elements of Ruby application security that you should employ throughout the development process.

Rather than dive into specifics like what-is-ssl or what-is-the-most-secure-hash-function, I will cover the most important tenets of security engineering such as educating your team, identifying attack surfaces, and utilizing the principle of least privilege--just to name a few. After explaining why a tenet is vital, I will show you how to apply it to your Ruby development processes."
66,Intro to Graph Databases,"Graph databases have increasingly become more popular when operating on highly interconnected data sets such as social network graphs and data powering recommendation engines.

Working with Ruby and some of the more popular graph databases, we will cover the definition of a graph database and explore some common scenarios in which graph databases can really shine over their traditional SQL and noSQL counterparts."
67,Writing Games with Entity Systems and JRuby,"Entity Systems are a relatively new style of software development that came out of the game industry to avoid some of the common architectural pitfalls of Object Oriented programming when developing games, and attempt to provide a much cleaner separation between aspects such as rendering, physics, AI and other parts of a game's ecosystem.

In this talk we'll live code a simple game with JRuby and libGDX and provide it with some interactivity and physics so you can get a feel for how Entity Systems work, and inspire you with your own game architectures.  Not only limited to games, this talk should also make you think about how you design other types of software that have a view layer powered by a highly dynamic data set."

The ability to work as much or as little as you need to can lead to extremes in each direction, either at the cost of profitability or at the exclusion of any open source at all.

In this talk I will discuss strategies that I have used to manage my time more effectively and maintain a positive work and life balance.  This will include the tools that I use, the processes that I try to follow and the attempts that I've made to separate the expectations and the disappointments of the open source software projects' users from my personal wellbeing while also remaining interested and motivated."

79,The Tip of the Iceberg: Development Was The Easy Part,"Production blindness (for lack of a better phrase) is a really big problem for web developers. Once they've struggled all the way through creating their app, they have to learn how to deploy it! And even if they know how to deploy it, they are unlikely to realize just how different production environments are from development. Without awareness of how production environments are different, we can't anticipate how they will break. Let's encourage thought and discussion about those differences when it's easy to make changes, not after production has gone down for the third time this month."
80,Ruby Hacking Practicum,"Have you ever dreamed of hacking a mainframe or infiltrating the network of a shady government organization? In this workshop, I will get you one step closer to achieving your dream.

You will learn about the most prevalent attack methods used to exploit Ruby applications by actually hacking some apps. There will be no theory and no fancy-talk, just hacking. For each attack method we cover, I will take you through three steps--detection, exploitation, and patching. Towards the end, I will share tools used by security experts to automate the detection and exploitation process.

Some attack methods you will learn more about:

* Cross-site request forgery
* Social engineering
* Cross-site-scripting
* Password attacks
* Rails-specific attacks


This talk is aimed at Ruby developers of any skill-level who want to learn more about security via hacking. By the end of the talk, you will be able to detect, exploit, and patch various security vulnerabilities. I will use Rails and Sinatra as hacking mediums, but the attack methods learned will apply to any Ruby application."

Some problems can be solved quickly.
Some problems can be solved slowly.
Some problems you should never, ever promise your boss you can solve in a reasonable amount of time.

Have you ever heard your boss tell a client, ""Sure, we can calculate the optimal route for your salespeople""? How about, ""Yes, we can determine the most efficient schedule for those activities.""

This talk will explain why those promises are a bad idea, and why you should always be very careful when promising absolutes. It will serve as a reminder for those who've met the P vs NP problem before, and a brief introduction to those who have not. 

And if you can solve them in an efficient manner on a Friday afternoon, there's a million dollars in it for you. Even if you can do it on a Monday morning!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

RuboCop is a static code analyzer. It analyzes your code to see if it follows style guidelines, such as those suggested by Bozhidar Batsov's Ruby Style Guide. It also performs linting of your code.

By default, RuboCop will report problems in your code, but for some problems, you can ask RuboCop to automatically correct them for you.

RuboCop is configurable. Each guideline is enforced by a single cop, which can be disabled, or configured to represent a modified guideline.

This talk will cover how to use RuboCop, including configuration, what it can detect, and how it is useful."

96,It's business time: How to metric,"You can't put a price on data. Great data tells stories about your customers and serve to inform or reinforce the decisions you make about your product. Great data should be readily available, easy to consume and be able to answer any question you want to throw at it.

The problem is that the applications we build are not well-suited for exposing data. What starts with a few SQL queries quickly turns many. More and more requirements come in, and by now you've written Ruby code to build reports. Then you need to put it in the UI so non-developers can access it whenever they want to. Maybe you have business intelligence people accessing your production data directly. However hard you try, tech debt quickly accumulates, making it difficult to change either your database or the reports you've created.

There's a better way. Let me show you how."

in ruby and then dive into some specific, fun projects such as:

- Controlling a Sphero and a Parrot AR Drone with ruby
- Using JRuby on Android to control GPIO on the Raspberry Pi via drb
- Building your own full-stack remote controlled robot using drb."

104,Cryptography Pitfalls,As developers we often do a poor job of implementing cryptography and other security measures in our systems. Often the primitives used are out of date and overlook very subtle flaws. These mistakes lead to systems that are hopelessly insecure despite our perception that we’ve build an impenetrable fortress. Fortunately there are a few tools and techniques at our disposal that can ease some of the pain. In this talk we’ll explore some of the most common pitfalls developers encounter with cryptography and restore some of our sanity.
