1,Continuous Delivery of Rails Applications,,"# Continuous Delivery of Rails Applications (or 'webscale' Rails)

Taking your app from it's infancy, and turning it into something that can serve tens of thousands of requests a minute, is no cakewalk. 

This talk will go through the steps to build a Continuous Delivery pipeline for your Rails Applications. Including:
  - Running your specs and features (of course)
  - Building an artifact
  - Provisioning resilient environments (Amazon or otherwise)
  - Inactive/Active setup, so you can manually 'gate' production releases
  - Automatic healing, so you don't get woken up in the middle of the night for minor things
  - Bonus: Suggestions on monitoring, alerting & backups",
3,UnderOS,,"# UnderOS

I would like to give a talk about a new exciting project called `under-os`, which is a full-scale browser-like abstraction on top of iOS that uses rubymotion and well, ruby.

It solves a really big problem in a really cool way. Basically, you've got rubymotion, which reduces the hassle of getting into the iOS apps development for rubyists, but it's still iOS, which is very alien to ruby itself and web-developers in general.

So, the ambition of this project is to write a full-scale abstraction in ruby on top of iOS, which will borrow a lot of concepts from the front-end development, like events, templates, stylesheets, etc. But we do it properly and in ruby.

In the end we will have a fully rubyists friendly stack that will be familiar to any web-developer and will drastically reduce the entry level for native apps development.",
4,Curly — Refactoring the view layer,,"# Curly — Refactoring the view layer

While most parts of Rails have been thoroughly overhauled during the past few years, one part has stubbornly refused improvement. The view layer is still by default using ERB to transform your app’s objects into HTML. Though HAML has gained a lot of traction, it is not a fundamental shift away from ERB, but rather a preference for putting HTML in your Ruby rather than the other way around.

More recent efforts in the realm of JavaScript have produced Mustache and its ambitious younger brother, Handlebars. While these are more radical in their attempt to separate structure and logic, they still do not feel like native Rails code.

While trying to solve a seemingly unrelated problem we discovered a design that suddenly enabled us to move past the limitations of ERB. Though different only in subtle ways, it struck just the right balance between integration with Rails and separation of concerns. We called it Curly.

I will show how we use the same old OO techniques that you already know to clean up our views, making them less prone to bugs, more readable, and more reusable.

I’ll also show how a seemingly small change of our conceptual model enabled us to add advanced behavior to our view layer without ending with an unmaintainable mess.

Curly is open source and available at http://github.com/zendesk/curly",

12,Learning from Smalltalk,"This talk covers the features, history and capabilities of Smalltalk and the benefits that it can hold for all Rubyists.","# Learning from Smalltalk

Smalltalk is an object-oriented, dynamically typed, reflective programming language. 
Smalltalk is a ""pure"" object-oriented programming language, meaning that, unlike 
Java and C++, there is no difference between values which are objects and values 
which are primitive types. In Smalltalk, primitive values such as integers, booleans 
and characters are also objects, in the sense that they are instances of corresponding 
classes, and operations on them are invoked by sending messages.

Sound familiar?

Smalltalk leaves a long shadow on the programming landscape and can be considered 
both as an ancestor and influence on the design of Ruby.  This talk introduces 
Smalltalk to Rubyists and covers software principles which can be applied to Ruby 
applications, both large and small.

Topics include:
* Brief overview
* Design
* Expressions
* Literals
* Messages
* Patterns
* Reflection",
13,tested_passion,"one talk proposal : a 1/4 technical, a 1/2 scientific and a 1/4 human.","# Tested passion

We have all heard the technical reasons why we should do test driven development, and we have all heard the burnout stories.

Have we heard the human reasons why tests are good and why a healthier daily schedule including them could avoid burn out ?

We are delicate organic systems that can work nicely if they are respected and used properly. We crash because we do too much. We continually push ourselves to work, deliver and build : we expect and are expected to produce a lot. We forget we are not factories producing tons of product every day. We are machines, biological ones, tailored by millennia of genetic history. Ignoring this, leads to crashes.

What is a proper schedule for our brain to learn and process information? Why can't we stay focused for 8 hours? What is the impact of sleep and naps? What is the impact of physical activity in our daily lives? How does TDD Fit in that process ?

In this talk we will see how much modern workplaces and schedules are disconnected from our biology, how we can change little things to avoid big crashes, work better and be happier.",

Ruby has one of the most unique and volatile communities in all of the programming world. Most recently, a number of social issues have come to light that have had a dramatic effect on the health of our community. This talk will look back at how the Ruby community has progressed in the past couple of years, where it has failed us and where it has pushed us forward.

16,"Fast, JSON-API-compliant, and ready for Ember Data",',"# Fast, JSON-API-compliant, and ready for Ember Data

We love Rails. We love Sinatra. We love snappy applications.

[Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) is carrying the convention-over-configuration torch forward from Rails into client-side MVC-land, and a big part of that convention is about standardising our JSON APIs.

The Ember.js data-persistence library, known as Ember Data, implicitly specifies an API that it 'expects' - an API that will require no configuration by the Ember application. [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/) is the name given to that specification.

This talk is about demonstrating different approaches for developing JSON-API compliant APIs in Ruby, hooking the APIs up to a basic Ember.js app, and contrasting the performance and maintainability of each API implementation.",

A detailed, deep-diving, in-the-deep-end and occasionally humorous whirlwind introduction and analysis of a suite of modern (and sometimes delightfully archaic) database technologies. How they work, why they work, and when you might want them to work in your Ruby and Rails application. 

At no extra charge I will also attempt to explain the oft-misunderstood CAP theorem, using databases as a device for understanding the trade offs and compromises inherent in building complex distributed systems.

Including but not limited to:

- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Cassandra
- Hyperdex
- MongoDb
- Riak
- Animated Gifs

The goal of the talk is to shed light on the wide range of options outside of the ""traditional"" PostgreSQL or MySQL. Ruby on Rails has a rather myopic focus on particular patterns of database interaction and technology on which lead developers to overlook other tools that may be really well suited for particular use-cases.

This talk is loosely based on my (award winning) Lightning Talk presented at the 2013 Australian Ruby Conference ""An Ode to 17 databases in 5 minutes"".
A 30 minute version was presented at the September 2013 Rocky Mountain Ruby Conference in Boulder, Colorado to wild acclaim (or at least some mildy positive feedback).",

Sometimes you are tasked with building great things by yourself or in a small team. Bootstrapped start-ups don’t always have the budget for a dedicated UXer to help you design the best apps, software or websites. So how do design great things without a UXer? 

This is not a definitive guide or to even to be used instead of getting professional UX help but it will get you started developing the right way and stop you making classic mistakes. Before you even consider touching your dev environment I will show you how to “Start with one idea”, “Think like a user” and set out your user journeys. From this solid foundation I will show you how to wireframe your logic and build a rough protoype. 

We then consider how to evaluate and iterate on your designs and what tools you can use. Finally, I outline the importance of never being afraid to scrap anything which doesn’t work. All without a single line of code being written.

20,Real Developers Ship,"In which we explore the tenets of a small team inside Envato who changed the way they work in order to deliver better and faster, and how you can too. Among other things, we'll cover continuous deployment, paying the refactor cost upfront, staying lean, and testing in production.","# Real developers ship (a.k.a Tenets for software delivery)

Not too long ago, a small group of developers inside Envato embarked on a mission: take an idea, and turn it into something real. To accomplish this goal, they didn't just have to build the product, but change the way they were writing and shipping code as well. In the end, the way they were delivering was radically different to anything they'd ever done before. The result? Mission accomplished.

This talk explores the core tenets of the team's delivery process, and explores the reasons behind the decisions that were made. It mixes anecdotes with practical examples, showing how changing the way you think can really help get things done.

Some of the tenets in the talk include:

* Level up your CI to continuous deployment
* Time is valued above all
* Staying lean with YAGNI
* Pay the refactor cost upfront
* Testing is best done in production
* Do things that don't scale
* Living on the bleeding edge
* The only way to move is forward

After listening to this talk, you will know how easy it is to introduce these principles into your Rails app. You'll be armed with ideas of what you can take home to your team, in order to deliver better and faster than before.",

machine-learning along the way?

In this talk, first up, we'll have a quick demo where an attendee
scribbles a number on a sticky note and a Ruby program tries
to recognize it. Then we'll pick it apart, covering:

+ the basics of machine-learning (and different applications)
+ brief look into the Math behind supervised learning (classification)
+ (mostly) hand-rolled code applying this Math
+ libraries/tools available to Rubyists (and choice of Ruby platforms)
 including:
   + weka
   + mahout
   + libsvm
   + Ruby `Matrix` class :)

These principles will be use for reflecting about the relevance of Ruby/Elixir for the Software Development","# Why Ruby/Elixir (culture) can make the difference in Software Development: A Behavioral Economics Reflexion

**Audience:** Rubysts and Software Developers at General

## Description
*Classical Economics* traditionally conceptualizes a world populated by agents calculating, unemotional maximizers bearing the name of Homo economicus. The classical economic ignores or dismisses virtually all human behavior studied by cognitive and social psychologists. The standard economic model of human behavior-realistic three features includes unlimited rationality, willpower and infinite selfishness without limits, all of which **Behavioral Economics (BE)** modifies it in a more *holistic* view based on *evidence* and *experiments*.

Software craftsmanship is an approach to software development that emphasizes the coding skills of the software developers themselves vs the view of practitioners of the well-defined statistical analysis and mathematical rigor of an engineering approach with the connotations of predictability, precision, mitigated risk and professionalism. Dan North wrote: *""No-one wants your steenking (sic) software – they want the capabilities it gives them, and they want those yesterday""*. 

Why Ruby and Elixir programming languages that are designed to make programmers happy have been hypothesized to be more effective in the long run because happy programers are more productive. But this is true? What other factors should be taken in consideration? The BE could offer some light to this based on the findings of the field as:
  * Labor and Motivation: Meaning, IKEA effect, Not-Invented here bias, Cognitive Dissonance, Monetary/Social Stress and Performance.
  * Self-Control: Difficulty with Self-Control, Reward Substitution, Ulysses Contracts
  * Psychology of Money: Cost Opportunity, Relativity, Mental Accounting, Loss Aversion, Endowment Effect, Market and Social Norms
  * Irrationality: Defaults, Preferences, Relativity, Long-lasting Effects of Decisions and Learning from our Mistakes

This principles will be presented in a practical way and how we can take advantage of those to reflect about the relevance of Ruby for the Software Development.

I present novel research that indicates that test suites for open source projects have an average of 25% redundancy, while those for closed-source projects have 40% or more. Redundant tests give teams the false sense of increased coverage. Further, they actually increase maintainability and running costs, while exposing the project to costly test escapes. Just as there is code that ""does the same thing,"" there are tests that ""test the same thing."" But how do you detect them? How do you find and deal effectively with them? This talk presents a solution: a free tool that quickly finds how redundant your test suite really is.
Audience will learn:
* The state of test suites in open-source projects, as well as in some closed-source projects.
* How redundant tests increase the risk and cost of testing.
* An introduction into several techniques to assess how good a test suite really is.
* An introduction into the tool and how to use it in their projects.

This is a general software engineering talk that will use solutions based in Ruby, aimed at Ruby development teams (Rails and RubyMotion).

Here's the long version:

- What is bad code? Where does it originate from?
  - How does bad code come to be? Can't we all just be better developers? - A broad look at what bad code is and some of the causes of bad code
  - Identifying bad code - A look at [code smells](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/05/code-smells.html)
  - What are the costs? - A look at the obvious and not so obvious costs of bad code. A review of the [opportunity costs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost) we deal with by accepting bad code.
  - The uniform skill level problem - Not all developers code at the same level of skill. A guide to how we can accomodate that as a team.
  - The uniform code quality output problem - Developers all have bad days. A guide to how we can deal with our bad days.
  - Know thy enemy: Developers - You are your own worst enemy. How to accept that you are not perfect and hopefully embrace a more humble and open-to-learn attitude. Do you need an attitude re-adjustment?

- How do we manage existing bad code?
  - Band aids are best for small cuts - A discussion on why I think band aid solutions should be absolutely avoided when maintaining code. A look at when you may have to use a band aid solution.
  - Refactoring is king - A look at how draconic refactoring should be used on older, less active code bases in order to rapidly and dramatically improve code quality
  - [The boy-scout rule](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_Boy_Scout_Rule) - A look at the boy-scout rule and why I think developers packing it in on older code bases is bullshit.
  - When to sever the limb - Is a complete rewrite ever called for? My experience with rewrites and why I think rewrites are often just a siren singing a song too good to be true.

- How do we prevent bad code, moving forward?
  - Refactoring:
    - I think refactoring needs to become embedded in the development life cycle. I'll explain how and why!
  - Code Reviews:
    - A look at the benefits of code reviews and discussion as to why I think code reviews need to be prioritised in the development life cycle. I'll explain how and why!
    - An overview of the various techniques (async vs sync, shallow vs deep, in person vs stuck to a wall etc)
    - How To: Automatic using [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/)
      - What kind of defects can Code Climate find?
      - How can I leverage Code Climate to improve code quality?
      - Is it worth it?
    - How To: Manual using [GitHub's Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
      - Building an informative description for your pull request to assist reviewers
      - Reviewing other developers work - you're probably being an asshole. I will go through some of the most common pit-falls when reviewing other developers's code. I will also be talking about ways to maximise the code review process. Problems you should look out for and refactoring options you probably hadn't considered. Some tips on how you can learn to become an better reviewer (Trust me! There's a colossal amount of variance in skill levels in reviewers - not necessarily correlated with the developer's programming ability, either).
  - Skill Development:
    - This is a pretty cheesy topic. I'll provide a laundry list of textbooks that all developers should read and some other text books specific to Rails and RubyMotion developers. This will include the classics like Code Complete, Peopleware, Pragmatic Programmer etc, which I will be quoting and drawing inspiration from extensively in this talk. I'll also include some textbooks you may not expect to see on a software developer's booklist.
  - Documentation will save your soul 6 months down the track:
    - A discussion on the role of documentation. When to document, when not to document. Examples specific to Rails and RubyMotion projects.
    - While you're here, why not [read my blog post on writing a good readme](http://blog.thefrontiergroup.com.au/2013/05/writing-a-good-readme/)?
  - Using gems (or cocoapods!):
    - A reminder to always look for a gem that is doing what you are trying to achieve. Code you don't write is code you don't have to maintain. There's a good chance the problem you're trying to solve is:
      - Already solved
      - Not as easy to solve as you think

38,AHAB: An HTTP Asset Bundler,"Introduction to the AHAB asset bundling protocol, its use in Rack applications, asset packaging in an HTTP 2.0 world, and using AHAB to try out code against production data.","# AHAB, An HTTP Asset Bundler

A good package management system is integral to building reliable, living
applications. The Ruby world is fortunate to have Rubygems and Bundler.

Each such system tends to get very high adoption within its own language, but
web applications are polyglot. Twitter-Bootstrap isn't written in Ruby, so
the authors don't publish them as gems. Instead, we
see a proliferation of *project*-for-*packaging sytem* wrappers:
[bootstrap-sass-rails](https://rubygems.org/gems/bootstrap-sass-rails),
npm's [bootstrap-sass](https://npmjs.org/package/bootstrap-sass),
[Bootstrap-Maven](https://github.com/efsavage/Bootstrap-Maven),
[components/bootsrap](https://github.com/components/bootstrap),
[bower-bootstrap-less](https://github.com/jozefizso/bower-bootstrap-less).

The AHAB philosophy is to move browser asset management to the one place all
web projects already agree on: the HTTP layer. This talk covers the AHAB
protocol and its usage in Rack applications, including both deploy-time- and
runtime asset resolution.",

You may have this vague sense that you don't know Ruby as well as you think you do.
And you worry that you're not learning and growing as a developer in your day job
as much as you did when you first picked up Ruby. Perhaps you've lost that spark
of excitement you experienced when you discovered new ways to solve problems with Ruby.

There is a way to re-invigorate your code and coding practices. Teach everything you know.

This talk will focus on some of the principals of teaching and why it can be an effective
tool, not only for others to learn, but for you as the teacher to really deepen your
knowledge of the subject. It will be specifically centered around using Ruby, and some of
the ways I have discovered work well for teaching it as a first programming language.",

Rubytus is a ruby gem, built by the team at [PicoCandy](http://picocandy.com), that implements the tus server protocol built on top of Goliath, a non-blocking (asynchronous) Ruby web server framework.

Resumable file upload should just work in the 21st century and developers shouldn't have to worry resuming file uploads from their web and mobile apps.

out why our chosen search solution doesn't work like we expect it to. Be it Sphinx, 
Solr, ElasticSearch, Postgres fulltext or `SELECT ... LIKE` queries that's not
always our jam and it can seem a bit like a dark art.

This talk goes into some first principles of information retrieval and at the
other end we will have a firm grounding in how to apply these practically to
whatever search solution you use to improve the experience of your users.

We'll use real-world examples, do some live demos and work through some user
stories in our journey towards better search.

Topics include:
 - Recall vs precision
 - Useful measures of quality
 - Tokenisation and analysis
 - Autocomplete/Typeahead
 - Ranking and scoring
 - Query parsing
 - Filtering
 - Context awareness",

This talk is about something important in the community. The ruby
community is missing something fundamentally important. We don't know
how to architect applications. We've grown accustomed to using
frameworks for everything and we've lost our way. We no longer talk
about making applications, we speak about applications build _in_
frameworks. Example: oh hey man, did you hear NewApp123 is built _in_
rails? I take offense to that. The application is not built in rails,
it's built in _ruby_ than rails is _used_ to put it online. This
mentality is prevalent in the community. It's damaging and encourages
technical debt.

My talk is about providing a new architecture based on solid OOP
principles such as the boundary between objects, SRP, proper logic
less views, application patterns, and good testing principles. All of
this in name of changing the way we write and maintain applications.

The talk follows this format:

* Introduction
* System Design: Object roles, boundaries, protocols, patterns, and delivery mechanisms
* TDD implementation of use cases, forms, models, and other object roles
* TDD implementation of HTTP delivery mechanism using Sinatra
* Problems withs Rails & Rails style MVC approach to web applications
* The ideal stack: calling out gems that exemplify qualities mentioned earlier
* Wrap up & conclusion
* How to migrate and redesign current systems

We want to produce reliable, functioning software... but we often don't. The cliched cry of ""but it works on my machine"" demonstrates the myopia that most web developers (including me) suffer from: we spend almost all of our time working with a development environment. This leads us to think of production as ""like development, with people using it"". Then, when things go wrong, we think ""oh, I see now, production is like development except this one thing that went wrong"". This is exactly the opposite of the mindset we need. Production is fundamentally different from development, and it's important to keep that in mind. This talk discusses some of those fundamental differences, including load balancing, metrics, data store reliability, and network partitions. Don't get stuck rebuilding your servers at 3AM because you went with the option that was easiest during development!

The stuff you need to know about it, why it's useful to consider - even if you're using
CRuby / MRI.

### Part 2: Hacking Sidekiq

The cooler part - once you know what Sidekiq is, I'm going to show how you can use
sidekiq in your product, how you can extend it and bend it to your will. I'll go into
how it implements itself in ruby land and how it interacts with the Redis.

I'll show how you can use the existing middleware (and write your own) to add behaviour
to your code, patterns we've found useful for implementing and testing workers as well
as the even more interesting side - using Lua support in redis to implement stuff in sidekiq.

I want to encourage developers to look at extending their tool set to work better with
not just ruby - to become comfortable with how they work internally (e.g. you should really
learn how to love redis) and what you really need to be careful of (e.g. bugs that manifest when
the site is under less load than usual - a real world example of going too far).

We'll look at the problems that prototypes can face; slippage, lack of focus and bloat. We'll see how our solution materialised out of Mint's company culture in a way that truly surprised us.

95,All Routes should Nest,,"# All Routes Should Nest.

In your RESTful application, every concept that you treat as a Resource
is related to at least one other Resource. Which of these relationships
should have nested routes? This is not just a Web problem.

If you answered ""just the ones I need"", you're doing it wrong.
If you're thinking about your nested URLs, you're probably doing it wrong.

By analysing practical examples using the theory of conceptual graphs,
I'll show why RESTful API design needs a new approach. All concepts in
your application are inter-related, and every API should automatically
allow requests for nested data, traversing any of these relationships,
including to multiple levels of nesting.  You shouldn't have to explicitly
nest any resource. We use already colon-include in ActiveRecord, but we
need it in our APIs too. Using this approach, we can design a new
generation of simple but super-flexible APIs.",
96,It's business time: How to metric,"You can't put a price on data. Great data tells stories about your customers and serve to inform or reinforce the decisions you make about your product. Great data should be readily available, easy to consume and be able to answer any question you want to throw at it.
The problem is that the applications we build are not well-suited for exposing data. What starts with a few SQL queries quickly turns many. More and more requirements come in, and by now you've written Ruby code to build reports. Then you need to put it in the UI so non-developers can access it whenever they want to. Maybe you have business intelligence people accessing your production data directly. However hard you try, tech debt quickly accumulates, making it difficult to change either your database or the reports you've created.

You can't put a price on data. Great data tells stories about your customers and serves to inform or reinforce the decisions you make about your product. Great data should be readily available, be easy to consume, and be able to answer any question you want to throw at it.

Somebody wants to know how many sales we did last month. You start off with some database queries to get the right numbers. Then you need to make it into a .csv. And wouldn't it be a good idea if we could segment by country? No problem, let's do some JOINs. Then the business people want the data on-demand, so let's put a UI around it and present it nicely. Add a dropdown to filter. And then it's time for the next question. However hard you try, tech debt quickly accumulates, making it difficult to change either your database or the reports you've created.

There's a better way. This talk is a deep dive into what that is, and how to implement that into your application.

In this talk, we'll look at how to determine what the important data is, and how to capture it in a way that doesn't mess with your app. We'll cover how to make data consumers jump up and down with joy. We'll use real code examples to demonstrate how easy it is to get it working. We'll talk about how this approach scales (spoiler warning: incredibly well) and how to manage growth of your product.

97,Tools to make your life easier,A talk on creating 'jigs',"# Homemade tools to make your life easier

In carpentry, a ""jig"" is a tool, often made from cheap plywood, just good
enough for one job. It's used a few times, then thrown back into the scrap
pile to be hacked into another tool the next time around.

In other words, this isn't your Uncle Bob's carpentry.

A _programmers'_ jig might rename 60 source files based on the class defined
in each. Or identify potential race conditions, by determining which globals
are reachable from different threads.

These jigs are code which operates on our code.  As such they hit the really
sweet niche of being fun, throw-away code _and_ built on fun computer
sciencey principles.

I'll talk about several principles and techniques for creating single-use tools.
We'll walk through a collection of jigs in Ruby, Bash, and a few other languages,
and talk about the jig-building patterns we need to keep in the toolchest to
make our lives as devs easier and more fun.",
98,Complexity Multipliers,,"# Complexity Multipliers

Ever been on that project where you've been able to turn around a new feature
inside an hour?  And then the next project where it takes six weeks to turn
around a feature that feels just about the same size?  You rack your brain,
and when you try to figure out why, all you come up with is small stuff.
""Well, I guess we have to commit twice for a config change instead of once…""

I posit there are a class of things which are ""complexity multipliers""–things
which seem small, but when a few of them get together, they have a major
impact on the velocity of the project.

The good thing is that complexity multipliers are easy to identify–if you
know what you are looking for.  They can be things inherent in the structure
of the code, in the development process, in the development tools.  I'd like
to show you some graphs and some common examples and define a conceptual
framework of how they affect projects.",

100,Modern Concurrency Practices in Ruby,,"# Modern Concurrency Practices in Ruby

So you think that concurrency is a subject lost in the Ruby world?
That it's not practical because of the GVL? That the concurrency
paradigm that's bundled with Ruby (a.k.a threading) is not the best
way to do concurrency? Or that you already have multi-processes and
don't need multi-threading concurrency.

Think again. The Ruby concurrency story has advanced a lot in the last
couple of years. Have you heard of people talking about actor-based
concurrency, using futures, Software Transactional Memory etc. and
want to know more about those?

This talk is a primer on these different paradigms of concurrency,
briefly touching on the traditional threads-based model, but focusing
more on modern paradigms like actors/futures/STM, with examples and
live-demos. Along the way we'll also see what's already possible in
Ruby (and in other implementations like JRuby and Rubinius, using gems
like Celluloid and friends).

PS: To add some variety, I'll employ the widely recognized but rarely
heard (at Rubyconf AU) Indian accent.",

In my wildest dreams, I never thought that I would become a software developer.
I thought that I wasn't smart enough, that I needed a computer science degree
and to have been writing code since I was young. But, the traditional path to
becoming a developer is changing. This talk will focus on alternative and
untraditional paths to becoming a developer such as programs like Railsbridge,
mentorship and apprentice programs. These alternative paths ultimately foster a
more diverse and inclusive community, which drives economic growth and produces
more innovative solutions. 
The objectives of the talk are: 
- to bring awareness to the educational alternatives to computer science degrees 
- to encourage empathy when mentoring a beginner 
- to get the audience to see a different perspective and embrace differences in

103,Using Ruby to Automate Your Life,,"# Using Ruby to Automate Your Life

## Abstract
You probably use Ruby everyday, so why not use Ruby to automate some common tasks?
What if you could spin up an EC2 instance and have it automatically configure your
web server, database, users, and more? What if you could effectively capture and
replicate your production environments reliably and consistently? What if you could
then give developers production-like environments as Virtual Machines, with no
additional work? What if you could set up your new laptop with multiple Ruby versions,
your favorite software, and even change the desktop background - from a single command?
The good news is - you can!

Chef is a configuration management and automation tool that solves these problems and
many more. In this talk, you'll learn common just how easy it is to capture your
infrastructure in Chef. Save time and money by using Chef's Ruby DSL to ""define"" your
laptop.

How many times have you bought a new laptop and realize just how much stuff you
installed over the years? If you're using Chef, run a single command and all your
favorite Applications, Preferences, and even passwords are back in place. And the best
part - because Chef is written in Ruby, you get to continue using the language you love!

## Additional Notes
Disclaimer: I work for Opscode, but this is not a sales pitch. I'm demonstrating a tool
that can save time and money. Plus is really fun!

I think this talk is really valuable information to Rubyist. Many similar Ruby conferences
(like Mountain West) have created a separate track for ""DevOps"". This new movement is
really gaining light in the community and I think showcasing a tool in the DevOps
world would be a nice change of pace.",

105,"You're doing it wrong - Business Logic, View Templates and faster Unit Tests",,"# You're doing it wrong - Business Logic, View Templates and faster Unit Tests

A blog in 15 minutes is great, but what happens when you're trying to build something truly complex?

Your view code turns to madness, with conditional statements spread throughout.

Your models turn into a complicated series of chained events that are hard to follow and difficult to wrap in transactions.

Your tests are comprehensive and slow to keep your application working.

But at least your controllers are skinny so you're doing it right. Right?

Wrong.

,Don't,,"We all know that intelligent species learn from mistakes, right?

There's just one problem: Life is too short to make every possible mistake! Also, some mistakes are more costly than others. What's the ambitious learner to do? I'm glad you asked! I'm an expert at making mistakes, and I'm happy to share as many of them as I can possibly fit into a 45-minute time slot with you, my dear conference attendee!

We'll discuss a variety of exciting mistakes, ranging from the misapplication of metaprogramming techniques to letting emotions become barriers to new technologies to why it's a horrible idea to stretch a gel keyboard wrist rest across a room, even if it seems like an awesome plan at the time.

Why should you accept this talk?

I have found that the best talks are about things the speaker can talk at length about, even without a script. This is a talk about stupid things I've done. Therefore, it follows that this will be the BEST TALK EVER.

But seriously, I get a ton of questions from junior developers and people who are just trying to figure out what they want to do next. I feel like I've given this talk already, a thousand times over, to individuals. It's probably just better to leverage economies of scale, and share with a whole room of people.

I plan to make the talk humorous, informative, and in general a good time for all.

,... but we had to kill unicorns,,"How often do you have to leave your comfort zone? How often does it happen that you need to change the fundamentals of your application?

Well… it has happened to my team some time ago. We had to abandon our way of thinking about Ruby on Rails applications. Single-threaded servers were not a choice anymore, neither was JRuby nor Event Machine. And we had to handle up to 200k requests per minute.

This talk is a case study about how, step by step, we got to multi threaded RoR application with MRI 1.9, MySQL, DataMapper. I want to present how we came to the solution, what did we have to do to make our application thread safe, how did we manage to use threads in MRI and what we learned while working on the big feature, that made us change the fundamentals of our application.

Although the application in this case was built with Ruby on Rails, the talk won't be specific to this framework. I want to talk about threading and parallelism in Ruby and its open source libraries, as well as the process of making deep changes in the application that handles pretty big traffic.",
,Front end Choices,,"# Front end Choices
## Should we be building our user interfaces the ""Rails Way""?

Rails was born in 2004, the time of the ‘Ajax revolution.’ With the help of a little bit of prototype, scriptaculous and RJS, Rails made its mark in part because it facilitated creating beautiful and highly interactive web user interfaces in no time at all.

Fast forward to 2013. Frameworks like [Meteor][meteor] and [Hoodie][hoodie] are capturing increasing mindshare. Are we now in the decade of JavaScript? Is the ""Rails Way"" still relevant to the Front End?

This talk will explore three approaches in two parts to build a front end for your Rails application:

1) In the first approach - ‘the Rails Way’ - I exploit all the parts of the default Rails stack, as blessed by DHH himself. This includes jquery-ujs, Turbolinks and Sprockets. Fundamentally with this technique, most HTML is still generated server-side.

Included in this part of the talk is a discussion if Progressive Enhancement makes sense, and a demonstration of the techniques involved.

2) The second approach is the ‘Angular Way’, exposed together with the 3) third approach, the ""Ember Way"". With both perspectives, I show how to build ""full"" client-side web applications.

Included in this part of the talk, in particular, are:
* a discussion about which of the two popular frameworks fits the Rails mindset best, and which brings the steepest learning curve,
* ‘to pipeline or not to pipeline’: does it still makes sense to stick with Sprockets or is more meaningful to use a separate build toolchain (e.g. grunt and bower) in the front end?

# Find Simplicity With Plain Old Ruby Objects


This talk will discuss why you might, when you set out to design a system, want to stop thinking about persistence. Rather than kicking off a project generating models that subclass `ActiveRecord::Base`, I will suggest beginning your application development by modelling behaviour with *Plain Old Ruby Objects (POROs)*.

While including ideas from [Avdi Grimm]'s [Objects on Rails], the talk will primarily be based around my personal experience refactoring an-ActiveResource based system with Plain Old Ruby Objects and [roar].

Included in this talk will be an exploration of:

- patterns, such as [Repository] and [Data Mapper], as coined by Martin Fowler,
- how upcoming libraries - Curator, DataMappify, ROM.rb and Veritas - fit in with these patterns,
- the parts of these libraries that are usable today,
- how to make this methodology workable in the context of TDD (keeping components as testable as possible).

There will also be a discussion about the stage when you should begin implementing persistence.

,Ruby Community: How a language reflects its people,,"# Ruby Community
## How a language reflects its people

Different computational languages bring different sets of culture and values, and a different group of interested people. ""The limits of your language are the limits of your world"", said Wittgenstein.

The Ruby community is known for having a very active user group. I will investigate some of the reasons for this, including the design, structure, semantics and grammar of the language itself and the departing point for its own culture established by Matz and core committers.

The talk also includes a run-down of my experiences running an event (eurucamp) by and for the Ruby community, and how everyone can participate in building a better community and this could help to continue building a better language.",
,Bridging the Gap to Unconscious Incompetence,,"Talk:
Q1: why are things like Rails Girls and Railsbridge necessary to engage women?
Q2: why don't men need outreach programs?
Q3: why do we need (more) women?
Q4: have we been asking the right questions?

Proposed answers and theories to research and present on:
A1: Supposedly, there are four stages of competence: (1)'unconscious incompetence' or 'you don't know what you don't know,' (2)'conscious incompetence' or 'you know what you don't know,' (3)'conscious competence' or 'you know what you know,' and (4)'unconscious competence' or 'you don't know what you know.' I visualise each level as a plateau with big gaps in between that have to be filled with knowledge and experience in order to cross over to the next level.

What I've found with working with Rails Girls (and inferred from hearing about Rails Bridge) is that there are plenty of women interested in becoming programmers, but they get stuck getting from level (1) to level (2). This is, in my opinion, the hardest level to bridge. How can you fill that gap with experience when you don't know where to even start? There are plenty of resources once you get to level 2: 'Learn Ruby the Hard Way,' Hartl's guide, RailsCasts, etc. But this requires a great deal of understanding of the domain. A RailsGirls workshop does not teach women how to create rails applications; the workshop teaches women how to learn to create rails applications. By giving them a few bits of vocabulary and a road map, they are set free to google (or bing?) useful searches and begin filling that gap to walk across to level (2).

A2: Many men, on the other hand, for various reasons, often have more familiarity with the domain even when they do not work in the technical realm. I am currently reading a book that goes into great detail on the 'why' of this called 'Unlocking the Clubhouse: Women in Computing.' I'm gaining some insight as to the why, but it does not change the current 'is' of the situation.

Trying to bridge gap (1) and (2) is where the most embarrassment can come into play. I remember when I was new to web development laboring over a question before posting it into our company chat. I'd rather spend hours going in circles on one issue rather than ask a question that didn't make sense. I finally learned that I had to ignore my pride and just ask. Sometimes my questions made sense, sometimes I was asking the equivalent of a @horse_recruiter tweet. However, I had a great group of supportive coworkers that never ridiculed me (to my face at least!).

Another theory that I have is that it is easier to cross that level (1) to (2) gap when you see others on the other side that you recognise and identify with in some way. I would wager that women can get into some other ares (knitting??) more confidently on seeing plenty of other successful women on the other side. The ""hey, I know and am familiar with that person' and the 'hey, that person is a lot like me"" on the other side makes asking for help that much more comfortable. When a woman looks from level (1), she doesn't see very many women on level (2) through (4) unless she spends some time hunting. Men who are interested in learning programming can show up to a meet up and immediately find other success stories to relate to.

A3: This question has been getting a lot of attention lately, so it might be redundant. But it is worth rehashing what I think is the biggest points: (1) if only one type of person engineers a solution, you lose out on other, potentially better, vantage points.

A4: I am concerned that while the push for 'more diversity' has yielded a lot of a attention where attention was needed, that maybe we need to start asking more important questions.

A quick closing thought: I look forward to the day where outreach workshops are not as needed. Hopefully by putting in the effort now, careers in technology will become a natural, unsurprising choice for any bright and ambitious young woman.",
